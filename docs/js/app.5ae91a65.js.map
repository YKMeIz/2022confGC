Most of the existing approaches mainly classify individuals into different catalogues or classes based on phenotypes and biomarkers. However, health status of an individual from a dynamical systems viewpoint can be viewed as a non-equilibrium steady state, which can generally be characterized by two key features, i.e. (1) homeostatic potential that represents the ability of homeostatic resilience to withstand perturbations or maintain functions at the current state or phenotype of this individual and (2) phenotypic potential that represents the state/phenotype of the individual on the whole process from health to disease, i.e., the current position of the individual. Here, we proposed a health state map (HSM) method derived from dynamic network biomarker method and diffusion map theory to quantify individual health status with the characterization of such two features in a robust and accurate manner based on multi-omics data. To verify our method, HSM method was applied to the quantification of diabetes mellitus (rat subjects) and the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (human subjects) for both disease progression process and recovery process, which demonstrated its effectiveness and potential for personalized medicine and preventive medicine.',\n            bio: 'Luonan Chen received BS degree in the Electrical Engineering, from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in the electrical engineering, from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 1988 and 1991, respectively.

From that study, we found that the matched histopathological images can provide complementary information, such as cellular phenotypes, cell density, cell/nucleus locations and non-cellular structures. Also, current ST data still suffer strong technical noises. Here, we present TIST, which enables accurate identification of spatial cluster (SC) and effective enhancement of spatial gene expression patterns. TIST devises a histological feature extraction method based on Markov random field (MRF) to learn the macroscopic cellular patterns from histopathological images and integrates them with transcriptomics and location information into a comprehensive network, termed TIST-net. Based on TIST-net, we realizes SC identification via a random-walk-based strategy and gene expression enhancement via neighborhood smoothing. We benchmarked TIST with 32 real and multiple simulated ST datasets and compared TIST against the start-of-the-art methods.

We therefore initiated a large-scale big data study to reanalyze and delineate the transcriptome landscape of ALL cases using RNA sequencing. Leveraging the information of gene expression enabled us to identify 14 subtypes in BCP-ALL and 10 subtypes in T-ALL.

There are no experimental or bioinformatic tools, to our knowledge, which can effectively delineate the tumour boundary. Advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) enlarge the application of single cell technologies to unveil the expression landscape of tissues with valuable spatial context. Here, we developed Cottrazm, construct tumour boundary microenvironment based on spatial transcriptomics, a computational tool enabling the integration of ST with hematoxylin and eosin-stained histological imaging data, and single-cell transcriptomics to delineate the tumour boundary connecting malignant and non-malignant cell spots. Further, Cottrazm is able to deconvolute cell-type composition at each spatial location and can reconstruct cell type-specific gene expression profiles at sub-spot level. We validated Cottrazm in six cancer types, including colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, to delineate the location, cellular composition along the malignant-boundary-non-malignant spatial axis, and cell-cell interaction of sub-spots in the spatial niche. We identified specific subtypes of macrophage and fibroblast that localized to the tumour boundary and interacted with tumour cells to generate a structural boundary which limits T cell infiltration and promotes immune exclusion in the tumour microenvironment.
