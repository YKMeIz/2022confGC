Most of the existing approaches mainly classify individuals into different catalogues or classes based on phenotypes and biomarkers. However, health status of an individual from a dynamical systems viewpoint can be viewed as a non-equilibrium steady state, which can generally be characterized by two key features, i.e. (1) homeostatic potential that represents the ability of homeostatic resilience to withstand perturbations or maintain functions at the current state or phenotype of this individual and (2) phenotypic potential that represents the state/phenotype of the individual on the whole process from health to disease, i.e., the current position of the individual. Here, we proposed a health state map (HSM) method derived from dynamic network biomarker method and diffusion map theory to quantify individual health status with the characterization of such two features in a robust and accurate manner based on multi-omics data.

This type of organized social system has three key traits: 1). There is no fixed rate of change 2). The system has some emergent characteristics (new behaviors, components or other adaptations that may arise from changing contexts) which are spontaneous and self-organizing 3). The influencers, predictors, and modifiers of human behaviors (actions and activities) are varied and variable in the system. Consequently, the effective and appropriate utilization, adoption and evaluation of digital health interventions and related data tools and assets within healthcare presents an ongoing challenge. These include poor uptake, inappropriate use, and abandonment over time. However, the field of implementation science provides a range of evidenced-informed principles to systematically overcome these challenges. These principles facilitate consistent, measurable, and contextually pragmatic strategies to adopt, evaluate and support the effective utilization of digital health tools and related data assets across and within health systems. This talk will present key evidence-based implementation principles to inform effective evaluation, assessment, and utilization strategies within digital health, using case studies from our own work.",bio:"Sunny is an Implementation Science Research Fellow at the Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation (AusHSI) at QUT.

Specifically, the groups is interested in modelling how variability of gene expression contributes to regulation of the transcriptome. This interest has led us very naturally into single cell biology where there is a great need to develop accurate statistical approaches for data arising from single cell sequencing. Elucidating heterogeneity and variability in gene expression in this context in important as this may uncover new cellular subtypes or identify stochasticity in the usage of key pathway or master regulators. The explosive availability of big data sets, coupled with the speed at which sequencing technologies have advanced have created an exciting environment for the current state of computational biology research. The Mar group looks to modern tools in statistics, such as Bayesian methodologies and machine learning algorithms, to make sense of biology from big data."},{name:"Associate Professor Xiaohui Tao",pic:"x.tao.png",position:"School of Mathematics, Physics and Computing, University of Southern Queensland, Australia",email:"Xiaohui.Tao@usq.edu.au",topic:"The Pursuit of Human-centered AI for P4 Medicine",abstract:"The healthcare and medical practice are now at a crossroad transforming from experience basis to evidence based.

However, such knowledge is essential to understand, predict, monitor, and control pathological processes like cancer and infections. We develop a spatial omics platform and machine learning software to identify most cell types and cell locations, quantify spatial molecular profiles, and detect cell-to-cell communication. This platform generates both spatial sequencing and tissue imaging data, two largest types of biological data. Analyzing the data allows us to model spatiotemporal relationship between cells across an undissociated tissue section. Such spatial models suggest genes and cell types that are potential drivers of biological changes associated with diseases. In this presentation, I will talk about predicting cancer progression from non-invasive to invasive states, identifying interacting cancer-immune cells, and studying host responses at sites of infections. Together, our spatial data, computational methods, and clinical collaborations enable us to elucidate important biological processes within diseased tissues.",bio:"Dr Quan Nguyen is a Senior Research Fellow and the head of Genomics and Machine Learning Lab at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience (IMB), The University of Queensland (UQ).
