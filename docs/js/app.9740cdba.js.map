Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, the development\n              of advanced data analysis technologies and wearable device-based disease management\n              become increasingly commonplace in healthcare practices. To further advance the\n              development of health research and practices, we need multidisciplinary expertise in\n              areas including software development, data management and cybersecurity, as well as\n              computational analysis and data integration. Led by Griffith University, Queensland\n              Government, Chinese Society of Biotechnology together with Queensland University of\n              Technology, University of Queensland, and University of Southern Queensland, a team of\n              leading experts will work together to hold this conference. The Conference on\n              Integration of Data Science, Information Management and Digital Technology into Health\n              Research serves as an excellent platform to bring these experts together to exchange\n              ideas and engage with industry partners. The conference also serves the purpose of\n              showcasing research excellence in Queensland, attracting students, businesses, and\n              academics from Asia to study, invest and collaborate with partners in Queensland.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"section section-updates bg-gray text-center\">\n      <div
