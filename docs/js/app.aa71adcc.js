Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, the development of advanced data analysis technologies and wearable device-based disease management become increasingly commonplace in healthcare practices. To further advance the development of health research and practices, we need multidisciplinary expertise in areas including software development, data management and cybersecurity, as well as computational analysis and data integration. Led by Griffith University, Queensland Government, Chinese Society of Biotechnology together with Queensland University of Technology, University of Queensland, and University of Southern Queensland, a team of leading experts will work together to hold this conference. The Conference on Integration of Data Science, Information Management and Digital Technology into Health Research serves as an excellent platform to bring these experts together to exchange ideas and engage with industry partners. The conference also serves the purpose of showcasing research excellence in Queensland, attracting students, businesses, and academics from Asia to study, invest and collaborate with partners in Queensland. </p></div></div></div></div><div class="section section-updates bg-gray text-center"><div class="container grid-lg"><h2>Purpose of The Conference</h2><div class="columns"><div

Most BCP-ALL and T-ALL can be classified into known major genetic subtypes, while a substantial proportion of them remains poorly characterized in relation to its underlying genomic abnormalities. We therefore initiated a large-scale big data study to reanalyze and delineate the transcriptome landscape of ALL cases using RNA sequencing. The combined results strongly advocate that RNA sequencing be introduced into the clinical diagnostic workup of ALL.",bio:"Jinyan Huang holds the position of the director of the Biomedical Big Data Center (BMBDC) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine.
