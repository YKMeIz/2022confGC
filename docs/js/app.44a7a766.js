Most of the existing approaches mainly classify individuals into different catalogues or classes based on phenotypes and biomarkers. However, health status of an individual from a dynamical systems viewpoint can be viewed as a non-equilibrium steady state, which can generally be characterized by two key features, i.e. (1) homeostatic potential that represents the ability of homeostatic resilience to withstand perturbations or maintain functions at the current state or phenotype of this individual and (2) phenotypic potential that represents the state/phenotype of the individual on the whole process from health to disease, i.e., the current position of the individual. Here, we proposed a health state map (HSM) method derived from dynamic network biomarker method and diffusion map theory to quantify individual health status with the characterization of such two features in a robust and accurate manner based on multi-omics data.

Such spatial models suggest genes and cell types that are potential drivers of biological changes associated with diseases. In this presentation, I will talk about predicting cancer progression from non-invasive to invasive states, identifying interacting cancer-immune cells, and studying host responses at sites of infections. Together, our spatial data, computational methods, and clinical collaborations enable us to elucidate important biological processes within diseased tissues.",bio:"Dr Quan Nguyen is a Senior Research Fellow and the head of Genomics and Machine Learning Lab at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience (IMB), The University of Queensland (UQ). He was an ARC DECRA fellow and is currently an NHMRC emerging leadership fellow level 2. He analyses single cell and spatial data to find cell types, their spatial organization and cell-cell interactions underlying differential responses to treatment and risks of cancer metastasis. He aims to find potentially new gene targets to modulate cancer-immune cell interactions and new markers to predict cancer progression and responses to drugs."},{name:"Professor Alan Liew",pic:"a.liew.png",position:"School of Information and Communication Technology, Griffith University, Australia",email:"a.liew@griffith.edu.au",topic:"Governing in the Digital Age: Use of Data for Better Policies and Public Services",abstract:"",bio:"Alan Liew is currently the Head of School, the School of Information & Communication Technology, and the Deputy Director of the Institute for Integrated Intelligent Systems (IIIS), at Griffith University, Australia.

With the continued expansion of electronic medical records (EMR), new models of digitally enabled health care delivery are being explored. High-risk, complex medications are key candidates for EMR intervention strategies to enhance patient safety. Exploration of the effect on EMR implementation within Queensland Health facilities has identified a reduction in hospital-acquired medication complications. Whilst these results are promising, such risks can be mitigated further through effective real-time data capture to establish continuous learning cycles and care improvement. Real-time analytics products are a viable method to harness and display aggregated data associated with high-risk medication management.",bio:"Jodie currently works for the Queensland Digital Health Centre at the University of Queensland.
