              Big data, information management, and digital technologies can provide actionable
              insights and decision-making, and are becoming increasingly important in health
              research and medical practises. Since the start of Covid, the development of advanced
              data analysis technologies and wearable device-based disease management become
              increasingly commonplace in healthcare practises. Led by Griffith University,
              universities in Queensland – Griffith University, Queensland University of Technology,
              University of Queensland, and University of Southern Queensland have developed such
              multidisciplinary expertise and a team of leading experts will work together to hold
              this conference. The Conference on Integration of Data Science, Information Management
              and Digital Technology into Health Research serves as an excellent platform to bring
              these experts together to exchange ideas and engage with industry partners.
