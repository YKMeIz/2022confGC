              Big data, information management, and digital technologies can provide actionable
              insights and decision-making, and are becoming increasingly important in health
              research and medical practices. Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, the development
              of advanced data analysis technologies and wearable device-based disease management
              become increasingly commonplace in healthcare practices. To further advance the
              development of health research and practices, we need multidisciplinary expertise in
              areas including software development, data management and cybersecurity, as well as
              computational analysis and data integration. Led by Griffith University, Queensland
              Government, Chinese Society of Biotechnology together with Queensland University of
              Technology, University of Queensland, and University of Southern Queensland, a team of
              leading experts will work together to hold this conference. The Conference on
              Integration of Data Science, Information Management and Digital Technology into Health
              Research serves as an excellent platform to bring these experts together to exchange
              ideas and engage with industry partners. The conference also serves the purpose of
              showcasing research excellence in Queensland, attracting students, businesses, and
              academics from Asia to study, invest and collaborate with partners in Queensland.
